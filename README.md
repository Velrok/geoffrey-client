# Geoffrey

Geoffrey Barbara Butler (played by Joseph Marcell), born in London on November 
5, 1947, serves as the Banks family's cynical butler. Geoffrey is the first 
character that appears on screen in the pilot episode The Fresh Prince Project. 

This project contains a client, which extracts show meta data from file names and
uploads it to a server, which shows a united list of all available shows
in the network.
By clicking on an episode it will be copied to a, probably shared folder, on the
clients, effectively enable on demand sharing.

## project maturity

The project is at a very early stage.
Right now only meta data is extracted and send to a server, where
a united list is shown.
Sharing and messages between client and server is still missing.


## setup

Consult the specific readmes for the client and server respectively.

## running tests
